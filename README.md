# Bobcat MT55 Main Drive Belt Replacement
### This guide is for a Bobcat MT55 main drive belt replacement, but it's the same for all of the other MT Mini-track loaders (MT50, MT52, MT85, and MT100).

## Tool List

* 14 mm socket (out)
* 15 mm wrench (in)
* 8 mm nut driver
* 13 mm socket and wrench
* 8 mm hex ratchet adapter
* Very long socket extension
* Fluid evacuation pump
* Slide hammer with swivel adapter
* Hook tool
* Rags or caps for hoses
* Flat Jaw Tongue and Groove Pliers
* Hydraulic Fluid Filter
* Hydraulic Fluid
* Main Drive Belt
* Parts to rebuild or replace the belt idler and pully (optional)

## This assumes that you have ripped some skin off of your hands with a wrench in them a time or two but I can’t think of anyone who couldn’t do this. It’s easy in my estimation. With patience on the tank removal. (Meditation and slow breathing techniques not included.)

### Instructions

**Step 1.** Remove guard above exhaust muffler and belts. (14 mm impact socket on the outside, 15 mm backing wrench on the inside)

**Step 2.** Remove air intake hose from filter to engine. (8 mm)

**Step 3.** Remove battery. (13 mm) (make sure you notice the washers on the threaded rod that holds down the battery clamp.)

**Step 4.** Remove the hydraulic oil filter.

**Step 5. Dealing with the Idler Pulley**

* **5a.** Mark the orientation of the idler pully bracket on the main drive belt that you are removing as it is not keyed. (It is mounted at zero degrees if your lazy).

* **5b.** Remove the side panel that allows access to the bolt. Then push the wiring harness up and out of the way of the bolt holding it in place, being somewhat considerate of the force applied and the angle of the bends in the wire.

* **5c.** With that out of the way you can loosen the bolt holding it in place by accessing it either from the access hole or with a very long extension from the back (the only practical way). Then allow it to rotate out of the way. (I don't know what the torque spec is for this component, but because it is not indexed, it is held in place purely by friction. Therefore, it needs to be rather tight on reassembly, and it is a big bolt so more torques.)

**Step 6. Removing the Hydraulic Fluid Tank**

It is likely possible to move the hydraulic pump far enough without removing the hydraulic fluid and tank, but the fluid is likely in desperate need of being changed, AND, you WILL spend way more time trying to get the belt out and back in. So just do it. You will thank yourself later.

* **6a.** Use a pump to evacuate the hydraulic fluid.

* **6b.** The bracket holding it in is tricky. The best approach is to pull the suction hose off the pump (stuff a rag in, or cap both openings), then rotate the hose 90 degrees on the tank elbow. (you’ll need a pair of pliers or better yet flat jaw tongue and groove pliers, because you have the room, to remove the clamp.)

* **6c.** Slide the tank as far towards the rear of the machine as it will go and tip the top away from the front of the machine. This should let the bracket top escape from under the hard lines it is behind. You can then jockey the bracket across and away from the tank.

* **6d.** Once that is done you can easily remove the return lines from the back of the tank.

**Step 7.** Remove the two bolts on either side of the hydraulic pump making sure that you retain the washers. (8 mm hex ratchet adapter)

**Step 8.** I used a slide hammer to pull the pump back. I used the swivel adapter and placed it between the two hydraulic fittings on the back of the pump.

**Step 9.** You can then turn the belt on its side and start to slide it between the pump mounting bracket and the main pully on the engine. It is easier to work it from right to left on removal and in the reverse when installing the new belt. Once it reaches the main shaft, use a hook tool to pull the belt through the pump mounting bracket slightly so it can clear the main shaft.

If you can't figure out how to put it back together from here, you likely don't have the cognitive ability to complete this process and should seek help from someone else.

All of the parts, belt, filters, and even the idler pulley tensioner are all off the shelf parts that can be bought from any supplier if you can figure out the cross reference. I couldn’t track down a local parts store  equivalent of the main drive belt, but I did acquire a generic one online. That said, it is likely the one component that I would recommend either buying from Bobcat directly, or finding a major brand equivalent because the one I ordered was shipped from China and while it looks good, the only reason I went ahead and installed it is because I have perfected the process of replacing it.

I would replace or rebuild the idler pully and tensioner unless it has been recently replaced, as it shouldn’t outlive the belt by much. They did improve the design some from the initial release so you might be able to simply replace the bearings and run with it, but on my 2006 MT55 I had to use a different bolt and new bearings that I had on had to basically remake the shaft that connects the pulley to the tensioner arm as mine had badly eroded.
